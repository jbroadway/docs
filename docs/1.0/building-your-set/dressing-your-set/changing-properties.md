## Movable

If this is selected, you will be able to pick up and move the prop during a recording.

> **Tip:** To avoid accidentally moving props that you know won’t be moved during a recording  (ex. large pieces of furniture), do not set the prop to moveable.

## Gravity

If this is selected, the prop will be affected by gravity.  If this is not selected, the prop will float in the spot that you placed it.

> **Tip:** Don’t select this option for things that are mounted on walls, like pictures or shelves.

## Respawn

If this is selected, when you grab the prop during a recording another one will automatically appear in its place.

> **Tip:** Select this option when you want an endless supply of something during a show.
