# Scaling your set

You can increase and decrease the size of your set while in the Set Builder.

> **Tip:** Try doing the bulk of your layout with the set scaled down to dollhouse size.
To finesse the placement of objects, scale your set to real size.

To scale the size of your set, **squeeze the grip and index trigger buttons on both controllers and move your hands away from each other** to make your set bigger or towards each other to make it smaller.  This will scale the entire set including your props.
