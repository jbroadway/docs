Choose the video camera from the Show Tools category on the Build palette to add a camera to your set.  You can place up to eight cameras to get a variety of angles of your recording.  There is a display attached to the side of the camera that will let you see your framing. See [[Recording a show]].

> **Important Note:** Your cameras will not show up in your recording.  If you want them to, see [Recording the Flipside User Interface](/docs/1.0/tips-and-tricks#recording-the-flipside-user-interface).

## Preview monitors

Preview monitors let you know what the active camera is seeing while you’re recording your show.  Place preview monitors around your set so you can always have a reference of the framing and camera angle while you’re acting.

> **Important Note:** Your preview monitors will not show up in your recording. If you want them to, see [Recording the Flipside User Interface](/docs/1.0/tips-and-tricks#recording-the-flipside-user-interface).

## Teleprompter

The teleprompter lets you see your script or other important information during the recording of your show.  

**To add your script to the teleprompter, follow these steps:**

1. Log in to the Flipside website to access your creator profile.
2. Click on the Teleprompter link. This will bring you to the page where you can add your script.
3. Paste your script into the text field.
4. Press the **Save** button. Now your script will be loaded when you add a teleprompter to your set in Flipside.
