# Dynamic Bone Setup

## Adding Dynamic Bones

Here is a quick overview of how to integrate the [Dynamic Bone](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743) Plugin with your custom Flipside characters.

1\. You will need to own a copy of the [Dynamic Bone](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743) asset to use this integration.

2\. Import the Dynamic Bone asset into your Flipside Creator Tools unity project.

3\. Add the DynamicBone component to the root of your character.

4\. Navigate in the Hierarchy to the root of your bones you want animated. Add that root object to the `Root` field in the **DynamicBone** component.

>At this point you should be able to play the scene, and see the bones reacting the movements.

5\. Adjust the values in the **DynamicBone** component until you are content with the look.

>Keep in mind that any changes made while Unity is playing will be lost when you stop it. To keep the changes you make while playing do the following:
	
>1\. Right click the **DynamicBone** component and click **Copy Component**.
