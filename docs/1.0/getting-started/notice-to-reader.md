# Notice to reader

Thanks for being an alpha tester for Flipside! We’ve been working non-stop for the past year to get Flipside to this point and need your help to make sure we’re making an app that fits all your needs as a creator.  We are grateful that you’ve agreed to be part of the extended Flipside team and we can’t thank you enough for taking the time help us on this journey.

## What does alpha mean?

An alpha release is the very first private release of an app.  The goal is to get Flipside into the hands of a small group of users to gather feedback on every aspect of the app. Consider this the first draft.

## What would we like from you?

We want to know what you think - everything from your opinion of Flipside as a whole to nitty gritty details on how we can make specific features better. 

Here are some things to think about while you’re using the app that would help us in our next phase of development:

* Is Flipside something that you would use?
* How do you see yourself using Flipside?
* Are there any features that you would love, but are currently missing?
* Are there any features that are there, but you can’t see yourself ever using?
* Did you get stuck anywhere?
* Did something not work?
* Is there a way for us to make something better?

## How do you give feedback?

There are two areas that we would love your feedback on - The app itself and the information in this user manual. 

Please use the Flipside Creator Community forum to submit your thoughts, any issues, or areas we can improve on: [www.flipsidexr.com/community](https://www.flipsidexr.com/community)

## Confidentiality

Your comments in the Creator Community will be visible to other community members. Any direct communication with us will be held in strict confidentiality, and will only be discussed internally with our development team to help make Flipside better. If any direct user feedback is discussed publicly, it will be in aggregate.
