# Monitoring with external headphones

If you have a second person who will be live editing your recording, the audio output can be monitored. 

**To monitor your performance with external headphones, follow these steps:**

1. Launch Oculus Home
   * Access Oculus home from your computer and **click the gear icon**, then choose **Settings**.
   * While in settings, choose **devices** from the left hand column menu. **Select the Oculus Rift HMD** icon to reveal additional settings.
2. Mirror audio
   * Make sure you **click on the settings switch** next to _“Let other hear my VR experiences”_ to enable audio to play from your computer. At this time, **plug in your headphones** into the headphone jack on your computer.  
3. Change your computer’s audio output
   * If you still can’t hear audio through your headphones make sure that Windows is routing your audio to your external headphones. **Click on the audio icon in your taskbar** and make sure the audio output settings are external headphones.
