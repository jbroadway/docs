**To view a take, follow these steps:**

1. Go to the **Recordings** palette.
2. Load the take you want to view into the player slot.
3. Press **Play**. You will be taken to the set of the recording and the take will start playing.

> **Important note:** The record palette will show all of your takes if no cartridge is
loaded in.  When you load in a cartridge, you will see all the characters are are in
that take. To get back to all of your takes, remove the cartridge.
