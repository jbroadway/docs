# BulletElement

The BulletElement component keeps track of who was holding the gun that fired it for the purposes of keeping score when the element hits a target or another player. A bullet has a **Destroy On Contact** property, as well as points to add when it hits a target or another player.

You can tie event handlers to the following list of events:

* **OnFired** - The bullet was fired.
* **OnHit** - The bullet has hit something.
* **OnHitTarget** - The bullet has hit a target.
* **OnHitPlayer** - The bullet has hit a player.
