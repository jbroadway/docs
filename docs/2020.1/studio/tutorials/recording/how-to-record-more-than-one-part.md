# How to record more than one part

Once you’ve completed a recording, you can change into another character, teleport to
another spot, and record a second part. This allows you to create recordings with
multiple performances.

**To record a show with multiple characters, follow these steps:**

1. Record a show with your first character.
2. Go to the **Characters** palette and choose another character.
3. Move to a different spot in your scene (this will prevent both characters standing in the same spot).
4. Go to the **Recordings** palette.  If the cartridge with the recording of your first character isn’t loaded, load it by **placing it into the player slot**.
5. Press the **Add Part** button on the **Recordings** palette. You will enter the scene with your first character and will be prompted with _‘3, 2, 1 Action’_.  
6. Act as your second character. The recording will automatically end. You will see that on your **Recordings** palette when you have this show loaded in, there are now two character parts associated with this recording.

> **Important note:** Currently, the first character of your recording determines the length of the recording.
