> Note: The video renderer is a paid feature. For more information, visit our [pricing page](/pricing).

The video renderer lets you render video from any camera in Flipside Studio in a variety of formats.

You can find the video renderer with these steps:

1. Insert a take for playback and wait for it to load.
2. Take off your headset to see the desktop interface.
3. Click on the button with the take name to open the take editor.
4. In the take editor window, click on the **Export** tab.

The video renderer looks like this:

### Features

Flipside Studio's video renderer works uses a background queue so you don't have to wait for a render to be finished before queueing up the next render, and you'll never forget to start the queue since it runs automatically.

You can render multiple cameras in a single render request, and you can pause the running queue or cancel a queued render.

The video renderer lets you customize your render options including output format, frame rate, anti-aliasing settings, and video encoding settings.

> Note: The queue is currently limited to multiple renders of a single take, but may be extended to support queueing renders for multiple takes in the future.

### Export options

The video renderer supports a number of different export options. For information on export options, visit the [video export page](/docs/2021.1/studio/references/exports/video-exports).
