# Utility belt

If you look down at your waist in Flipside, you'll see a utility belt with commonly used tools.

On the right, you'll see a holster with a camera attached. This enables you to quickly grab the
handheld camera and begin filming, or capture a photo or selfie to share on social media.

On the left, you'll see a holster with a puppet attached. This lets you control your character
in puppet mode, where your hand becomes the character, enabling you to walk around a larger
area than your VR tracking space.
