# How to use facial expressions

Flipside Studio will animate certain parts of your face automatically. This includes mouth movements that simulate lip syncing as you talk, and simulated natural eye movements.

Flipside Studio also provides some control over facial expressions:

**Step 1.** Hop into any character (see [[:how to embody characters]]).

**Step 2.** Look at the preview mirror on the characters menu.

**Step 3.** Press **up** on your left hand joystick to make a **happy** expression.

**Step 4.** Press **down** on your left hand joystick to make a **sad** expression.

**Step 5.** Press **left** on your left hand joystick to make a **surprised** expression.

**Step 6.** Press **right** on your left hand joystick to make an **angry** expression.

You can use these expressions as you talk to add visible emotions to your character's face.
