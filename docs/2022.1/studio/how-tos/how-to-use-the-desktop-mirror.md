# How to use the desktop mirror

> Note: The desktop mirror is a desktop-only feature and is not supported on the Quest.

The desktop mirror is a feature that mirrors what's shown on your desktop monitor on a panel in VR so you can see your Windows desktop.

## Enable the desktop mirror feature

The desktop mirror requires a PC with a dedicated GPU and can't support PCs with integrated graphics. For this reason, the feature is disabled by default and needs to be manually enabled before you can use it.

**Step 1.** Take your headset off and look at Flipside Studio's user switcher interface on your desktop.

**Step 2.** Click on the settings icon along the bottom of the screen. It looks like a little gear icon.

**Step 3.** Under the **General** tab, change the **Desktop Mirror** setting to **On (Desktop Mirror Enabled)**.

**Step 4.** If you have multiple monitors connected, select the monitor you wish to mirror under the **Monitor to mirror** setting.

You should now be ready to use the desktop mirror in VR.

## Using the desktop mirror

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Props** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Choose **All Props** then go to the **Show Tools** category.

**Step 3.** Click on one of the **Desktop Mirror** props in the list to add it to your set.

Note that there are two desktop mirror props. One is visible only to you and the other is also visible to cameras so audiences can see it. Use one or the other, depending on whether you want your audience to see your desktop in the output or not.

Also note that the desktop mirror will not appear the same over multiplayer. Each user will see a mirror of their own desktop.
