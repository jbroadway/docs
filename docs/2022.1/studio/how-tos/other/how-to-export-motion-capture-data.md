# How to export motion capture data

> Note: Data exports are a subscription-only feature of the desktop version of Flipside Studio.

**Step 1.** Select and load the recording in the **Recordings** menu that you want to export video of.

**Step 2.** Take your headset off and look at Flipside Studio's user switcher interface on your desktop.

**Step 3.** Click on the button with the recording's name along the bottom of the desktop switcher interface. This will bring up the **Take Editor** menu.

**Step 4.** Choose your **BVH Format** from the dropdown on the bottom.

**Step 5.** Click **Export All BVH** to export your recording's motion capture data.

**Step 6.** Click **Open Export Folder** to be taken to your exported BVH files.

> Tip: Use the [Flipside Creator Tools](/docs/2022.1/creator-tools/getting-started) plugin for Unity or our Flipside Plugin for Blender to import the BVH files into those applications.
