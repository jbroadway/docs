# Motion capture exports

> Note: Exporting data is a paid feature. For more information, visit our [pricing page](/pricing).

Flipside Studio lets you export your motion capture data as [BVH files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biovision_Hierarchy). You can choose between Standard, Processed, and 3DSMax formats.

You can find the BVH export options with these steps:

1. Insert a take for playback and wait for it to load.
2. Take off your headset to see the desktop interface.
3. Click on the button with the take name to open the take editor.

You should see the take editor window open, which should look like this:

From here, you can export the BVH data for individual parts or all of them at once.

### Using your motion capture data

BVH files are supported by a wide range of 3D software, but we've created two ways to make make them easier to use in the Unity game engine and the Blender 3D editor:

1. Using the [Flipside Creator Tools](/flipside-creator-tools), you can convert your BVH files into regular Unity animations. Mechanim and legacy animations are both supported.
2. Using our [Flipside Plugin for Blender](/flipside-plugin-for-blender), you can convert your BVH files into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) animations.
