# ObsElement

This component lets you trigger a scene change in [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) via Flipside Studio if you have Flipside Studio connected to OBS on your desktop. This can be used to automate OBS scene changes in coordination with other changes in your show, such as playing interstitial videos during scene changes.

There is one method that can be called from any Unity event:

* **SetCurrentScene(sceneName)** - Change to the specified scene in OBS.
