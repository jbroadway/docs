# TeleportTarget

TeleportTarget lets you define target positions that the Flipside Studio teleporter should lock onto so actors can quickly teleport to their correct positions. They're an embedded version of Flipside Studio's actor marks that you can pre-define directly in your sets.

TeleportTarget can also trigger Unity events in the scene on the following interactions:

* **TeleportEvent** - A user has teleported into this target.
* **LeavingEvent** - A user has teleported away from this target.
