# How to embody characters

Flipside Studio lets you act as if you're the characters in your shows, animating them based on your movement and speech.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Characters** from the main menu.

Once your character has loaded, you should see a ghostly outline of your character moving along with you. You should also see your character in the mirror attached to the Characters menu.

**Step 3.** Use the preview mirror to get a feel for how your character moves.

**Step 4.** Choose another character from the menu and see how they feel.
