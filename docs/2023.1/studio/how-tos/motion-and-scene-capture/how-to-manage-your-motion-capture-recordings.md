# How to manage your motion capture recordings

Flipside Studio provides a number of tools to help you manage your motion capture recordings. These are primarily found in the **Recordings** menu.

**Step 1.** Renaming a recording.

Open the **Recordings** menu and click on the **Rename** icon beside the recording you wish to rename.

Flipside Studio sorts most assets alphabetically by default except for recordings, which it defaults to sorting by date.

Flipside Studio provides one additional way of organizing your recordings, which is through [[studio / concepts / projects]]. Whenever you make a new recording, it will be added to the currently-opened project, which you can see along the top of the **Recordings** menu.

To change projects, go to **All Projects** in the main menu and choose a different project or create a new one.
