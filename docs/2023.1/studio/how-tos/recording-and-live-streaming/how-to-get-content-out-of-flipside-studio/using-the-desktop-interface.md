# Using the Desktop interface

>**Note**: The desktop interface is only available on the desktop version of Flipside Studio.

Flipside Studio’s **Desktop Interface** gives you the ability to view the active camera from the **Camera Switcher** in VR, control cameras from outside of VR, as well as access Flipside Studio's settings on the PC attached to your headset. Use any live streaming or screen capturing software like [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) to stream or capture video of your Flipside Studio content.

The main window area is your active camera output. Along the bottom are the director controls. On the right are previews for each camera position.

The director controls work with [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) to record and stream shows to platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and others. See [[Studio / Tutorials / Recording / Editing your show / setting up OBS Studio]] for info on how to set up and configure Flipside Studio's OBS integration.

The options on the bottom include:

* **Record/Stop Recording** - Starts and stops an OBS video recording.
