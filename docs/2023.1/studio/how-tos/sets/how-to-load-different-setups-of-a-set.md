# How to load different setups of a set

Once you've created a saved setup or two (see: [[: how to save multiple setups of a set]]), here's how to load them up:

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Sets** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Find your set in the menu.

**Step 3.** Click on the dropdown menu at the bottom of the set listing and choose **Setups**. This lists all of the available setups for a given set.

**Step 4.** Click on one of the setups to load its configuration.

> Note: When you have a recording loaded in the Recordings menu, loading a setup will only replace the camera configuration on the set and will leave props as they were in the recording.
