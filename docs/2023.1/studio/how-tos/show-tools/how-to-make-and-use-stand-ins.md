# How to make and use stand-ins

Stand-ins are a unique feature in Flipside Studio that lets you freeze one or more characters in their current pose. They can then be used as actor marks and as references for setting up cameras without the need for live actors or stand-ins to be on set while setting up your shots.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Characters** from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Click **Pose** in the **Stand-ins** section along the bottom of the menu.

There will be a 3-second countdown and then Flipside Studio will capture each user that's in a character. Users that are invisible will be omitted.

**Step 3.** Teleport to a new position then click **Pose** again to create additional stand-ins around the set.

**Step 4.** Aim your teleporter at one of the stand-ins then press your index finger trigger to teleport to its actor mark position.

The stand-in character will disappear and you'll be changed into that character if you weren't already.

**Step 5.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Props** from the main menu.

When the Props menu is open, you'll be able to grab your stand-ins to move adjust their positions on the set or remove them. You can also remove all stand-ins by pressing **Clear** in the stand-ins section of the characters menu.
