# How to use the teleprompter

Flipside Studio features a teleprompter for actors to be able to refer to scripts during production.

> Note: To customize your scripts, [log into your creator account on flipsidexr.com](flipsidexr.com/user) then go to **Projects** and click on the **Scripts** link for the project you wish to add them to. Scripts belong to a project so they can be shared with the whole project team.

**Step 1.** Press the menu button on either controller and choose **Teleprompter** from the main menu.

This will add a teleprompter controller to your set.

**Step 2.** To change scripts, click on the **Scripts** button along the bottom of the teleprompter controller.

This will bring up a list of available scripts from the currently open project.

**Step 3.** Click on any script to open a preview of it in the scripts list.

**Step 4.** Click **Load Script** to load the script and return to the teleprompter controller.

Each actor gets their own teleprompter controller and the teleprompters are synchronized so the whole cast is always on the same page.
